# Monopoly Game (Java OOP)

A robust and interactive implementation of the classic board game **Monopoly**, built using **Java** and **Swing** GUI. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, custom UI components, and game state management.

## 🎮 Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: A visual representation of the standard Monopoly board with custom rendering.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Supports 2 to 4 players with character selection.
- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Roll dice with animations.
  - Buy properties, utilities, and railroads.
  - Pay rent and handle bankruptcy.
  - Draw **Chance** and **Community Chest** cards.
  - **Jail** mechanics (Go to Jail, Get out of Jail).
  - **Mortgage** system for properties.
  - **House/Hotel Development**: Build houses to increase rent.
- **Rich UI**:
  - Player information panels showing balance and assets.
  - popup notifications for game events.
  - Custom settings for game display.
  - Bilingual support (Vietnamese/English interface elements).

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (Recommended for running and editing).

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Duy133009/Monopoly.git
    cd Monopoly/Monopoly
    ```

2.  **Compile the source code**:

    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Main.java`: The entry point of the application.
- `GameEngine.java`: Core logic handling turns, rules, and state.
- `GameBoardPanel.java`: Renders the game board.
- `Player.java`: Represents a player entity.
- `DicePanel.java`: Handles dice rolling logic and animation.
- `images/`: Directory containing game assets (tokens, board icons, etc.).

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Swing / AWT
- **Concepts**: OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), Event-Driven Programming, custom graphical rendering.
